# sudoku_go
A sudoku solver written in Go

This code defines a simple Sudoku solver using backtracking. It checks if placing a number in a cell is safe and recursively attempts to solve the puzzle. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

The initial code was generated by Copilot and doesn't work - the fun challenge was to fix it.
